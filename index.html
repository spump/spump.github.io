        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p><strong>SPuMP (Space Pharma Microgravity minituarized pump), D-Pump
(Diaphragm pump) and Multiplexed Pump</strong> are new miniaturized, accurate
pumping systems, developed for SpacePharma’s microgravity research activities
in space. The unique features makes them a value component in other special
micro-fluidics devices such as:
          
          <ul>
            <li>Medical devices</li>
            <li>Point Of Care (POC) devices</li>
            <li>Portable analytical instruments</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fade-in two">
        <h2>Unique features</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provides accurate flow rates in range of 10-500 microliters/min</li>
          <li>Non-pulsating, positive displacement pumping</li>
          <li>Bubble-free opeation</li>
          <li>Built in temperature control (heating and cooling) for pump and reservoir.</li>
          <li>Built for harsh enviromnent</li>

        <h2>Comprehensive flow-management possibilities</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>SPuMP</strong> is a 2 ml syringe pump operated by a step-motor. The syringe
reservoir is temperature controlled.
        </p>
        <p>Up to 4 <strong>SPuMP-s</strong> can be separately controlled from one main controller.</p>
        <p>The <strong>D-Pump</strong> is a diaphragm pump with temperature-controlled 1.4 ml reservoir.
It is hydraulically driven by a SPump, acting as an accurate hydraulic driver.
        </p>
        <p>
The Control board, manifold and valve systems enable independent Operation of
4 SPuMPS, each driving two D-Pumps, acting together as a <strong>Multiplexed pump</strong>,
where each D-Pump is operated independently with repeating pumping-refilling

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>SpacePharma’s mission is to provide researchers with a simplified and valuable
method for conducting microgravity research in space.
The company has gained expertise in micro-fluidic flow, miniaturized systems,
advanced controls and durable design for extreme conditions. It was realized that

these applications call for a better, smaller and more accurate pumping system
compared to commercially available devices.</p>
