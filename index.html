        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p><strong>SPuMP</strong> is a one of a kind new pump that is pulsation free, has on reservoir temperature control, and is designed for use in extreme environments - such as the <strong>microgravity environment of space</strong>.</p>
        <p>We hope you will follow along here on this website for exciting product updates about our progress and pre-sale efforts.</p>

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>SpacePharma’s vision is to provide researchers’ with a simplified and valuable method for conducting research in microgravity. At heart of these research platforms are lab-on-a-chip devices. These systems are fluid driven, thus requiring pumps to drive the fluid through the system. Microgravity, space based research imposes a large number of constraints on the system as a whole including small size (20x10x10cm), limited power resources, and being able to withstand strong forces during launch to space just to name a few. In the development of the SpacePharma Advanced Lab (SPad), SpacePharma saw a need for a miniaturized, accurate, pulsation free pump for microgravity research. This is how SPuMP was born.
